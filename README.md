<h1> Time-lab </h1>

<h3> How to compile the source code. </h3>

<b>1.</b> Download it.

If you're on GNU/Linux, you can easily clone the repository using git.

```
git clone http://github.com/ZDDM/Time-lab.git
```

If you're on Windows, you can use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

An alternative would also be [downloading it directly](https://github.com/ZDDM/Time-lab/archive/master.zip).

<b>2.</b> Get [BYOND](http://www.byond.com/download/).

<b>3.</b> Open **Time lab.dme** with DreamMaker and build it.

You should see this:

```
saving Time lab.dmb (DEBUG mode)
Time lab.dmb - 0 errors, 0 warnings
```
If you see any errors or warnings, something has gone horribly wrong.
You should try to redownload the source code, or if the issue persists, [complain about it](https://github.com/ZDDM/Time-lab/issues/new).
